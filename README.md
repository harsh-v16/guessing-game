# Guessing Game (Python)

A simple command-line guessing game where the user has to guess the secret word within a limited number of attempts.

## 🎯 How It Works:
- The program has a hidden secret_word (in this case: "giraffe")
- The user is allowed up to 3 guesses
- If the correct word is entered, the user wins
- If all guesses are used up, the user loses

## 🔧 Features:
- Input handling using input()
- Conditional logic with if-else
- Loop control using while
- A basic introduction to game logic in Python

## 💻 Example Output:
Guess the word: cat
Guess the word: tiger
Guess the word: monkey
Out of Guesses, You Lose!
or:
Guess the word: giraffe
You Won!
